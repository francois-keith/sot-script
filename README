======== COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION ===========
 -- compilation and installation
Customize the file ./cs.sh : please provide the source directory SOURCE_DIR and the install directory SOT_ROOT
Eventually, provide the boost path and the eigen path.

Once done, run
$ ./cs.sh pull
$ ./cs.sh build

  -- install robot-viewer.
Robot viewer is a simple tool to visualize a scene involving a robot, written in Python

The installation instruction are in https://github.com/laas/robot-viewer

If you choose to install via apt-get, be aware that it may raise the following error:

SyntaxError: ('invalid syntax', ('/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/robotviewer/legacy.py', 19, 31, 'def parse_config(self, config)\n'))

Tough it has no impact on the execution.

After installation, a patch needs to be applied
sudo cp robot_viewer/patch/kinematics.py  /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/robotviewer/kinematics.py

robotviewer will take informations from the ~/.robotviewer folder.
To create it, you can run
$robotviewer
This will creates symbolic links in ~/.robotviewer/

please customize the file robotviewer/config and copy it as ~/.robotviewer/config



Complete PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Simplest solution consists in adding this to your .bashrc
Otherwise, add those lines in the second console (see below).

# assuming that SOT_ROOT is defined.
export PYTHONPATH=$SOT_ROOT/lib/python2.6/site-packages/

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SOT_ROOT/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SOT_ROOT/lib/plugin


======== RUNNING THE SIMULATION =======


In the first console, run
$ robotviewer -s XML-RPC

This will start the viewer in a new window. press h to toggle the help of the viewer

In a second console, go the source directory  $SOURCE_PATH/Sot-Romeo/sot-dyninv/python
Then run
$ python -i ./kinesimple_romeo.py
To run a simple kinematic simulation.


run
$ python -i ./dyn_romeo.py
To run a simulation of the dynamic simulation

Then type in the python output
% go 
to run 100 iteration of the control
or
% inc()
to run 1 iter
