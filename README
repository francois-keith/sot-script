Thanks for you interest in the stack ot tasks software.
This compilation script is now deprecated, you should rather use
the following one:

https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/install-sot

This script allows you to keep the several packages up to date, 
and allows you to bind it with ros electric, fuerte, groovy and hydro.
